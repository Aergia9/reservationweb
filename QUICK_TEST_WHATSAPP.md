🔍 **Testing WhatsApp Bot Events Issue**

Send **"2"** to your WhatsApp number: **+15556297952**

The bot should now show detailed logs in Firebase Console.

## Check Firebase Console Logs:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/reservationweb-4b61a/functions/logs)
2. Select **Functions** → **Logs** 
3. Filter by **whatsappWebhook**
4. Look for recent logs when you send "2"

## Expected Log Messages:
- ✅ "Getting events from Firestore collection 'event'"
- ✅ "Found X total events in database"
- ✅ "Processing event: [event name]" with details
- ✅ Date filtering results
- ✅ "Found X ongoing events"

## If No Logs Appear:
The WhatsApp webhook might not be receiving messages. Check:
- Webhook URL in Meta Developer Console
- WhatsApp Business API configuration

## Quick Test Commands:

### Test WhatsApp Bot:
Send to WhatsApp number: **2**

### Alternative: Check Firestore Directly
Let's also verify your event data structure directly in Firestore.
