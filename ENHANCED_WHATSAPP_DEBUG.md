# ðŸ”§ Enhanced WhatsApp Bot - Event Collection Debugging

## âœ… **Updated WhatsApp Bot Deployed!**

The WhatsApp bot now has **enhanced debugging** and will:

1. **Check both collections**: `'event'` and `'special-events'`
2. **Log detailed field information** for each event found
3. **Handle different field names**: `name` or `title` for event names
4. **Show all available fields** in each event document

## ðŸ§ª **Test Your WhatsApp Bot Now:**

### **Send "2" to your WhatsApp number**

The bot will now provide **detailed logs** showing:
- âœ… How many events found in each collection
- âœ… Field names and values for each event
- âœ… Date filtering process
- âœ… Final events that will be displayed

## ðŸ“‹ **Check Firebase Console Logs:**

1. Go to [Firebase Console Logs](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/reservationweb-4b61a/functions/logs)
2. Look for these log messages after sending "2":
   - `"Getting events from Firestore collection 'event'"`
   - `"Found X total events in database"`
   - `"Processing event: [name]"`
   - `"allFields: [field names]"`

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Solutions Based on Results:**

### **If No Events Found:**
- Your `event` collection is empty
- Need to add events through your admin panel

### **If Events Found but Wrong Structure:**
- Events might have `title` instead of `name`
- Missing required fields like `price`, `endDate`

### **If Events Found but All Filtered Out:**
- All events have `endDate` in the past
- Need to update event dates

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the bot** by sending "2"
2. **Check the logs** in Firebase Console
3. **Share the log results** with me
4. **I'll provide the exact fix** based on what we find

The enhanced logging will show us **exactly** what's in your event collection! ðŸ“Š
